    <h1>DOM in JavaScript</h1> 
    <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. <b>It is used to access elements to manipulate the content, structure, and style of web pages dynamically</b></p>
    <p><b><u>It is used to access elements of a web page and modify them using JavaScript.</u></b></p>
    <p>JavaScript can use the DOM to perform various tasks, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Accessing and modifying HTML elements and their attributes.</li>
        <li>Changing the content of elements, such as text or images.</li>
        <li>Adding or removing elements from the document.</li>
        <li>Handling user interactions, such as clicks, form submissions, and keyboard events.</li>
        <li>Manipulating styles and classes to change the appearance of elements dynamically.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To interact with the DOM, JavaScript provides several selectors such as:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Basic Selectors</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>
                    Select By ID
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The getElementById() method is used to select an HTML element by its unique ID attribute. It returns a reference to the first element with the specified ID. This method is commonly used to access and manipulate specific elements on a web page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Syntex :- document.getElementById("Id_Name");
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>
                    Select By ClassName
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The getElementsByClassName() method is used to select HTML elements by their class name. It returns a live HTMLCollection of all elements that have the specified class name. This method is useful for accessing and manipulating multiple elements that share the same class.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Syntex :- document.getElementByClassName("Class_Name");
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>
                    Select By TagName
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The getElementByTagName() method is used to select HTML elements by their tag name.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Mordern Query Selectors</li>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <h2>
                "#Id_Name"
            </h2>
            <p>
                 The querySelector() method is used to select the first HTML element that matches a specified CSS selector. It returns a reference to the first matching element in the document. This method is versatile and can be used to select elements using various CSS selectors, such as IDs, classes, tags, and attributes.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Syntex:- document.quarySelector("#Id_Name");
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>
                ".Class_Name"
            </h2>
            <p>
                The querySelector() method is used to select the first HTML element that matches a specified CSS selector. It returnsa reference to the first matching element in the document. This method is versatile and can be used to selectelements using various CSS selectors, such as IDs, classes, tags, and attributes.

    <p>Overall, the DOM is a crucial part of web development, enabling developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications by manipulating the structure and content of web pages in real-time.</p>

    <h2>NodeList()</h2>
    <p>A NodeList is a collection of nodes, which can be elements, text nodes, or other types of nodes in the DOM. It is similar to an array but does not have all the methods and properties of a standard JavaScript array. NodeLists are often returned by methods that select multiple elements, such as getElementsByClassName() or querySelectorAll().</p>
    <p>NodeLists can be live or static. A live NodeList automatically updates when the underlying document changes, while a static NodeList does not change after it is created. For example, getElementsByClassName() returns a live NodeList, while querySelectorAll() returns a static NodeList.</p>
    <p>To work with a NodeList, you can use a for loop or the forEach() method to iterate over its items. You can also convert a NodeList to an array using methods like Array.from() or the spread operator ([...nodeList]) to take advantage of array methods.</p>
    <p>Overall, NodeLists are a useful way to work with collections of nodes in the DOM, allowing developers to manipulate multiple elements at once.</p>
    <h2>HTMLCollection()</h2>
    <p>An HTMLCollection is a collection of HTML elements in the DOM. It is similar to a NodeList but specifically contains only element nodes. HTMLCollections are often returned by methods that select multiple elements, such as getElementsByTagName() or getElementsByClassName().</p>
    <p>HTMLCollections are live, meaning they automatically update when the underlying document changes. For example, if you add or remove elements from the document that match the criteria of the HTMLCollection, the collection will reflect those changes in real-time.</p>
    <p>To work with an HTMLCollection, you can use a for loop to iterate
    over its items. However, HTMLCollections do not have the forEach() method like NodeLists. You can also convert an HTMLCollection to an array using methods like Array.from() or the spread operator ([...htmlCollection]) to take advantage of array methods.</p>
    <p>Overall, HTMLCollections are a useful way to work with collections of HTML elements in the DOM, allowing developers to manipulate multiple elements at once.</p>
