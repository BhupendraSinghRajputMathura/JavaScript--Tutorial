  <h1>ðŸ“˜ Introduction to JavaScript</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>JavaScript</strong> is a versatile programming language primarily used to enhance the interactivity and functionality of web pages. 
    It is a <strong>client-side scripting language</strong>, meaning it runs directly in the userâ€™s web browser, allowing developers to create 
    <strong>dynamic content</strong> that responds instantly to user actions â€” without reloading the page.
  </p>

  <p>
    JavaScript was <strong>created in 1995 by Brendan Eich</strong> while working at Netscape Communications. Initially developed in just 10 days, 
    it was first named <em>Mocha</em>, then <em>LiveScript</em>, and finally <em>JavaScript</em>. Despite the name, JavaScript is <strong>not related to Java</strong>; 
    the name was chosen for marketing purposes due to Javaâ€™s popularity at the time.
  </p>

  <p>
    JavaScript is a <strong>high-level, interpreted language</strong> that supports multiple programming paradigms â€” including 
    <strong>procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming</strong>. Its flexibility and ease of use make it suitable for both beginners and experienced developers.
  </p>

  <h2>ðŸ”¹ Interaction with the DOM</h2>
  <p>
    One of JavaScriptâ€™s most powerful features is its ability to manipulate the <strong>Document Object Model (DOM)</strong>.  
    The DOM represents the structure of a webpage, allowing JavaScript to:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Dynamically update content and text</li>
    <li>Change styles and attributes in real time</li>
    <li>Handle user actions such as <code>click</code>, <code>submit</code>, or <code>keydown</code></li>
    <li>Add or remove elements from the page dynamically</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This DOM manipulation capability makes JavaScript essential for building modern, responsive, and interactive websites.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>ðŸ”¹ JavaScript in Modern Development</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of <strong>libraries and frameworks</strong> like 
    <code>React</code>, <code>Angular</code>, and <code>Vue.js</code> that simplify the creation of complex, large-scale web applications.
    With the introduction of <strong>Node.js</strong>, JavaScript can also be used for <strong>server-side development</strong>,
    making it possible to build full-stack applications entirely in JavaScript.
  </p>

  <p>
    JavaScript now powers not just websites, but also mobile apps, desktop software, and even IoT devices â€” making it one of the 
    most widely used programming languages in the world.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>ðŸ”¹ JavaScript vs HTML and CSS</h2>
  <p>
    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three foundational technologies of web development. Each has its unique role:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</strong>  
      Defines the <em>structure</em> and <em>content</em> of a webpage â€” including headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</strong>  
      Controls the <em>appearance</em> and <em>layout</em> of the webpage â€” including colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>JavaScript:</strong>  
      Adds <em>interactivity</em> and <em>dynamic behavior</em> to webpages â€” enabling animations, data updates, and real-time user interactions.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In short:  
    <strong>HTML</strong> provides the structure ðŸ§±,  
    <strong>CSS</strong> defines the style ðŸŽ¨, and  
    <strong>JavaScript</strong> adds life âš¡.
