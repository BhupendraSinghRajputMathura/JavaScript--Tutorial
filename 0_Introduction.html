    <h1>Introduction of JavaScript</h1>
    <p>JavaScript is a versatile programming language <b>primarily used for enhancing the interactivity and functionality of web pages</b>. <b>It is a client-side scripting language, meaning it runs in the user's web browser</b>, allowing developers to <b>create dynamic content</b> that responds to user actions without needing to reload the page.</p>
    <p>JavaScript was <b>created in 1995 by Brendan Eich</b> while working at Netscape Communications Corporation. It was initially developed in just 10 days and was originally named Mocha, then renamed to LiveScript, and finally to JavaScript. Despite its name, JavaScript is not related to Java; the naming was a marketing strategy to capitalize on the popularity of Java at the time.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a <b>high-level, interpreted language that supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming</b>. It is known for its flexibility and ease of use, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced developers.</p>
    <p>One of the key features of JavaScript is its ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the structure of a web page. <b>This allows developers to dynamically update content, style elements, and handle user interactions such as clicks, form submissions, and keyboard events</b>.</p>
    <p>JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, and Vue.js, which simplify the development of complex web applications. Additionally, with the advent of Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for server-side programming, enabling developers to build full-stack applications using a single language.</p>
    <p>Overall, JavaScript is an essential technology for modern web development, enabling the creation of interactive and engaging user experiences on the web.</p>

    <h3>JavaScript vs HTML and CSS</h3>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript are three core technologies used in web development, each serving a distinct purpose:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML:</strong> HTML is the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of a web page. It defines elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and forms. HTML provides the skeleton of a web page, organizing content in a hierarchical manner.</li>
        <li><strong>CSS:</strong> CSS is used to control the presentation and layout of a web page. It allows developers to apply styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning to HTML elements. CSS enhances the visual appearance of a web page, making it more attractive and user-friendly.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It enables developers to create features such as animations, form validation, interactive maps, and real-time updates. JavaScript can manipulate both HTML and CSS, allowing for responsive and engaging user experiences.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In summary, HTML provides the structure, CSS handles the styling, and JavaScript adds interactivity to web pages. Together, these three technologies form the foundation of modern web development.</p>
