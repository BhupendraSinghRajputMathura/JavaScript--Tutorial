        Variable in JavaScript
    </h1>
    <h2>
        A variable is a container for storing data values.
    </h2>
    <h3>
        there are 3 ways to declare a variable in JavaScript:
        <ul>
            <li>var</li>
            <li>let</li>
            <li>const</li>  
        </ul>
    </h3>
    <p>
        note:
        <ul>
            <li>Variables declared with var or let can be reassigned.</li>
            <li>Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned.</li>    
        </ul>   
        Example:
        <ul>
            <li>const panCard = "1234-5678-9012-3456";</li>
            <li>let age = 25;</li>
            <li>var name = "John Doe";</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                 In the above example, panCard is a constant variable that cannot be changed, age is a variable that can be reassigned, and name is a variable that can also be reassigned.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prefer using const for variables that should not change, and let for variables that may change. Avoid using var to prevent scope-related issues.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

        interview Question: What is the difference between var, let, and const in JavaScript?
        difference between var, let and const:
        <ul>
            <li>Scope:
                <ul>
                    <li>var: Function-scoped. Accessible throughout the function in which it is declared.</li>
                    <li>let: Block-scoped. Accessible only within the block (enclosed by {}) in which it is declared.</li>
                    <li>const: Block-scoped. Accessible only within the block in which it is declared.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Reassignment:
                <ul>
                    <li>var: Can be reassigned.</li>
                    <li>let: Can be reassigned.</li>
                    <li>const: Cannot be reassigned after its initial assignment.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Hoisting:
                <ul>
                    <li>var: Hoisted to the top of its scope and initialized with undefined.</li>
                    <li>let: Hoisted to the top of its block but not initialized. Accessing it before declaration results in a ReferenceError (temporal dead zone).</li>
                    <li>const: Hoisted to the top of its block but not initialized. Accessing it before declaration results in a ReferenceError (temporal dead zone).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Use Cases:
                <ul>
                    <li>var: Generally avoided in modern JavaScript due to its function scope and hoisting behavior, which can lead to unexpected results.</li>
                    <li>let: Used for variables that may need to be reassigned, such as loop counters or values that change over time.</li>
                    <li>const: Used for variables that should remain constant throughout the program, such as configuration values or references to objects/arrays that should not be reassigned.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>   
        </ul>
        Example:
        <ul>
            <li>var x = 10; // function-scoped, can be reassigned</li>
            <li>let y = 20; // block-scoped, can be reassigned</li>
            <li>const z = 30; // block-scoped, cannot be reassigned</li>
        </ul>
