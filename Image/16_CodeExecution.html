    <h1>Code Execution Context In JavaScript</h1>
    <p>The code execution context is an abstract concept that holds information about the environment within which the current code is being executed. It includes details such as variable scope, the value of 'this', and the order of function calls.</p>
    <h2>Types of Execution Context</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Global Execution Context:</strong> The default context where any JavaScript code runs initially.</li>
        <li><strong>Function Execution Context:</strong> Created whenever a function is invoked, containing its own scope and variables.</li>
        <li><strong>Eval Execution Context:</strong> Created by the eval function, allowing for dynamic code execution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Execution Context Lifecycle</h2>
    <p>The lifecycle of an execution context can be broken down into three phases:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Creation Phase:</strong> During this phase, the context is created, and the scope is established. Variables are hoisted, and function declarations are processed.</li>
        <li><strong>Activation Phase:</strong> The context is activated, and the code begins to execute. The value of 'this' is determined, and the local variables are initialized.</li>
        <li><strong>Termination Phase:</strong> Once the code has finished executing, the context is destroyed, and any resources are released.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>GEC (Global Execution Context)</h2>
    <p>The Global Execution Context (GEC) is the default context where any JavaScript code runs initially. It is created when the JavaScript engine starts executing the code and serves as the outermost context.</p>

    <h3>Characteristics of GEC</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Single instance: There is only one global execution context in a JavaScript environment.</li>
        <li>Global scope: Variables declared in the global context are accessible from anywhere in the code.</li>
        <li>Window object: In a browser environment, the global context is associated with the window object.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FEC (Function Execution Context)</h2>
    <p>The Function Execution Context (FEC) is created whenever a function is invoked. It contains its own scope, variables, and the value of 'this' specific to that function call.</p>

    <h3>Characteristics of FEC</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Multiple instances: A new function execution context is created for each function call.</li>
        <li>Local scope: Variables declared within the function are not accessible from outside.</li>
        <li>Closure: Inner functions have access to the outer function's scope.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Eval Execution Context (EEC)</h2>
    <p>The Eval Execution Context (EEC) is created by the eval function, allowing for dynamic code execution. It has its own scope and can access variables from the surrounding context.</p>

    <h3>Characteristics of EEC</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Dynamic scope: The scope is determined at runtime, allowing for more flexible code execution.</li>
        <li>Access to outer variables: EEC can access variables from the surrounding context, similar to closures.</li>
        <li>Security concerns: Using eval can lead to security vulnerabilities, as it allows for the execution of arbitrary code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Execution Phases</h2>
    <p>The execution phases of a context can be divided into three main stages:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Creation Phase:</strong> This is when the context is created, and the scope is established. Variables are hoisted, and function declarations are processed.</li>
        <li><strong>Activation Phase:</strong> The context is activated, and the code begins to execute. The value of 'this' is determined, and the local variables are initialized.</li>
        <li><strong>Termination Phase:</strong> Once the code has finished executing, the context is destroyed, and any resources are released.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Call Stack</h2>
    <p>The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the execution contexts in a JavaScript program. It follows a Last In, First Out (LIFO) order, meaning that the most recently added context is the first one to be removed.</p>
    <p>When a function is called, a new execution context is created and pushed onto the call stack. When the function returns, its context is popped off the stack.</p>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <pre>
        <code>
            var a = 10; // Global Execution Context (GEC)
            var b = 20; // Global Execution Context (GEC)

            function add(x,y) {
                var c = 30; // Function Execution Context (FEC)
                return x + y + c;
            }

            add(); // Function Execution Context (FEC) is created and pushed onto the call stack
        </code>
    </pre>
    <h2>Execution Flow:-</h2>
